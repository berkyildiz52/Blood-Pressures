# Import data and create vector

# 1.Variables are quantiative discrete.Data are multivariate.
# 2.Pie chart, bar chart,dotplots, stem and leaf plots can be used. We can see how are data's location, spread, shape and are there any outliers.
# 3. a.) Calculate the sample mean.
tapply(data$SYSBP, data$GENDER, mean)
tapply(data$DIASBP, data$GENDER, mean)
# b.) Calculate the sample variance.
tapply(data$SYSBP, data$GENDER, var)
tapply(data$DIASBP, data$GENDER, var)
# c.) Find the sample standard deviation.
sdsysbp <- tapply(data$SYSBP, data$GENDER, sd)

sddiasbp <- tapply(data$DIASBP, data$GENDER, sd)
sddiasbp
# d.) Find the lower and upper quartiles.
# Lower quartile, is the value that cuts off the first 25% of the data when it is sorted in ascending order.Upper quartile, is the value that cuts off the first 75%.
tapply(data$SYSBP, data$GENDER, quantile)
tapply(data$DIASBP, data$GENDER, quantile)
# e.) What are the maximum and minimum values?
minmaxsysbp <- tapply(data$SYSBP, data$GENDER, range)
minmaxsysbp
minmaxdiasbp <- tapply(data$DIASBP, data$GENDER, range)
minmaxdiasbp
# f.) Calculate the range.
rangesysbp <- lapply(minmaxsysbp,diff)
rangesysbp
rangediasbp <- lapply(minmaxdiasbp,diff)
rangediasbp
# g.) Compare the range and the standard deviation. The range is approximately how many standard deviations?
100/13.51935
70/13.55459
54/10.352743
60/9.838468
# h.) What is the median?
tapply(data$SYSBP, data$GENDER, median)
tapply(data$DIASBP, data$GENDER, median)
# i) Calculate the IQR.
tapply(data$SYSBP, data$GENDER, IQR, na.rm = FALSE)
tapply(data$DIASBP, data$GENDER, IQR, na.rm = FALSE)
# j.) Calculate five-number summaries.
tapply(data$SYSBP, data$GENDER, fivenum)
tapply(data$DIASBP, data$GENDER, fivenum)
# k.) Construct box plot for the data set. Are there any outliers? What does the box plot tell you about the shape of the distribution?
tapply(data$SYSBP, data$GENDER, boxplot)
tapply(data$DIASBP, data$GENDER, boxplot)
# k1. There are 4 outliers. Shape of the distribution is skewed left.
# k2. There aren't any outliers. Shape of the distribution is symmetric.
# k3. There are 3 outliers. Shape of the distribution is skewed right.
# k3. There are 5 outliers. Shape of the distribution is skewed right.
# l.) Construct and interpret stem-and-leaf plot.
tapply(data$SYSBP, data$GENDER, stem)
tapply(data$DIASBP, data$GENDER, stem)
# l1. There are outliers. Shape of the distribution is skewed left.
# l2. There aren't any outliers. Shape of the distribution is symmetric.
# l3. There are outliers. Shape of the distribution is skewed right.
# l3. There are outliers. Shape of the distribution is skewed right.
# m.) Construct and interpret histograms. In this solution, you will use different number of subintervals to construct the histograms and then compare the results
# m1.) use 5 subintervals to construct the histograms and then interpret the graph
tapply(data$SYSBP, data$GENDER, hist,breaks=22)
tapply(data$DIASBP, data$GENDER, hist,breaks=10)
# m2.) use more subintervals (more than 5 subintervals) to construct the graph and then interpret the graph
tapply(data$SYSBP, data$GENDER, hist)
tapply(data$DIASBP, data$GENDER, hist,breaks = 5)
# m3.) compare two results above and discuss which one is better and why.
#Subintervals with 5 is more detailed than subintervals with 10. Lower subintervals are better.
# n.) Draw a dotplot of this data set. Are the data mound shaped?
#Only women systolic blood pressure data set is mound shaped.
# o.) Can you use Tchebysheff’s Theorem to describe this data set? Why or why not?
#Yes, Tchebysheff’s Theorem must be true for any data set.
# p.) Can you use the Empirical Rule to describe this data set? Why or why not?
#Yes just for the second one.Only women systolic blood pressure data set is mound shaped.
# q.) Given data sets of two groups, construct and interpret a comparative dotplot to compare the groups
tapply(data$SYSBP, data$GENDER, dotchart)
tapply(data$DIASBP, data$GENDER, dotchart)
# Second one is more widely distrubuted than first one.Third one is more in centered than fourth.
# r.) Construct a relative frequency histogram for these data. How would you describe the shape of the distribution?
h<-hist(data$SYSBP, plot=F)
h$counts <- h$counts / sum(h$counts)
plot(h, freq=TRUE, ylab="Relative Frequency")
#Symmetric distrubution
h<-hist(data$DIASBP, plot=F)
h$counts <- h$counts / sum(h$counts)
plot(h, freq=TRUE, ylab="Relative Frequency")
#Skewed right
# s.) Find the z-scores for the largest and smallest observations. Would you consider them to be outliers? Why or why not?
